            Plant-Powered Plates aims
            <strong>to inspire kids to combat climate change through sustainable food 
              choices.</strong>
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase w-100">HOW?</h2>
          <p class="w-100">
            Using kid-friendly and engaging videos, handouts, and activities, we
            hope to motivate children to create positive environmental change
            through their everyday eating habits.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase w-100">HOW EXACTLY?</h2>
          <p class="w-100">
            Specifically, our initiative includes the Plant-Powered Plates
            Challenge, a school-wide competition encouraging kids to create their
            own plant-based entrees, some of which can be incorporated into school
            lunch menus. Through this challenge and our other climate-related
            activities and lessons, we hope to empower children to spread
            environmental awareness and activism in their schools, families, and
            communities. We also hope that our program will encourage more
            nutritious and sustainable options in school lunch menus, ultimately
            fostering a generation of healthier and more environmentally-conscious
            citizens.
