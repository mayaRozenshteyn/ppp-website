            <h2>WHAT?</h2>
            <p>Plant-Powered Plates aims <strong>to inspire kids to combat climate change 
                through sustainable food choices.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div id="HOW">
            <h2>HOW?</h2>
        <p>Using kid-friendly and engaging videos, handouts, and activities, we hope to motivate children to create positive environmental change through their everyday eating habits. </p>

        </div>
        <div id="HOWEXACTLY">
            <h2>HOW EXACTLY?</h2>
            <p>Specifically, our initiative includes the Plant-Powered Plates Challenge, 
                a school-wide competition encouraging kids to create their own 
                plant-based entrees, some of which can be incorporated into school 
                lunch menus. Through this challenge and our other climate-related 
                activities and lessons, we hope to empower children to spread 
                environmental awareness and activism in their schools, families, and 
                communities. We also hope that our program will encourage more 
                nutritious and sustainable options in school lunch menus, ultimately 
                fostering a generation of healthier and more environmentally-conscious citizens.</p>
